# Phase 0 Operations

Azure Functions hosts a thin ASGI adapter around FastAPI. Functions and routes contain no business logic. Configuration is loaded through typed Pydantic Settings, production secrets are never committed, and persistent state belongs in PostgreSQL.

Apply database changes only through Alembic:

```text
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Future timers and external calls must be idempotent, timeout-bounded and retry-bounded.
